# Fish Species Detection with Mask R-CNN

## Introduction

This repository contains a project for fish species detection using **Mask R-CNN**, a powerful object detection algorithm. The model is trained to detect and segment different fish species in images or videos.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries and tools:

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-image
- Mask R-CNN package

You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:
1. Installation
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YathrebSamaali/FishSpeciesDetection-MaskRCNN.git
   cd FishSpeciesDetection-MaskRCNN

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Features:
- Fish species detection using Mask R-CNN
- Instance segmentation (detecting and segmenting multiple objects)
- Results visualization (bounding boxes, segmentation masks)
- Ability to process multiple images

## Results

You can use the system to detect fish species from images. Below is an example of an image used for testing.
